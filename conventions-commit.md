# Conventions commit

## Form of commits

Commits must be made in the following form : `<emoji> <type>(<scope>): <description>`

## Different types

We have 8 different types :

- build : changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (npm packages, other...)
- feat : add a new feature
- fix : bug fix
- refactor : changes that not add features but only for the performance improvement or the code style
- style : this is specific to CSS and HTML when we have relation between both
- docs : redaction or documentation update
- test : add or test changes
- other : this should be avoided because it adds no semantics but can be used in specific cases
